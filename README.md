# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-Employee-Churn

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Load the Dataset
2. Preprocess the Data
3. Split the Data
4. Build and Train the Model
5.Evaluate the Model
6.Predict New Data

## Program:
```
